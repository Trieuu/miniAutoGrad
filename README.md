__miniAutoGrad__

Before moving to more detail of the project, I want to give a great thank to __Andrej Karpathy__ for his lecture about the Back Propagation and training process (on how things work in this training step).

You can find __Andrej Karpathy__ in the below link:

>> [Andrej Karpathy's micrograd repo](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)

>> [Andrej Karpathy's The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd](https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0?si=giG-cNp3i0chlrn3)

In this repo, what i have done so far is to reconstruct the structure of the Lecture of Andrej about this topic and adding some of my explaination in the __Mini AutoGrad__ notebook. Beside that , I also make some modify on the __Value__ class (which you will see in the repo engine.py file) for a better visualizarion purpose. Lastly, I also test the Neural_Network on other dataset which is the Iris datase.
